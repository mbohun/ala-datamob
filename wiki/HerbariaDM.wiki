#summary Herbaria data mobilisation root

== Welcome to the Herbaria data mobilisation pages ==

  * [http://goo.gl/VY2Qe Herbaria data mobilisation proposal] - (summary follows)
    * This document is a draft proposal for data mobilisation into the atlas of herbaria data:
      * 1. let RBG Victoria continue to manage the aggregation of BioCASe data providers
      * 2. RBGVic to push an export to the ALA daily in simple-hispid5 format, containing changed records (delta), plus a full listing of record identifiers only (to communicate any deletions)
    * In addition to this, some work to improve the quality of data within the group and the wider community:
      * 3. generate a completeness model for hispid5 â€“ a planning tool that allows any organisation using the hispid5 standard to analyse quality completeness; [http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModel]
      * 4. use the completeness model to review the existing HISPID-5 BioCASe mappings of the CHAH partners;
    * Finally, some work to help organisations within the community to share data:
      * 5. make available a second, less complex data transfer option for data providers with lesser capability or more restricted infrastructure ('simple-hispid5' csv);
      * 6. generate bi-directional mapping software that can be used to convert simple-hispid5 to hispid5-xml;

    * Preface
      * The aim of this paper is to outline the requirements and issues for data mobilisation so that HISCOM can reach a decision on a strategy for future data mobilisation and aggregation. This paper is a straw man, i.e. a brainstormed simple proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to provoke the generation of new and better proposals.
    * Recommendations
      * HISCOM to endorse the two-step aggregation model advocated by ALA, using  MEL as the aggregation point for the coming few months. This will enable the AVH portal to go live as soon as possible and allow us to debug the data providers and do the necessary quality checks on the provided data.
      * HISCOM/CHAH to request ALA to work on the model with a single data aggregation point in the ALA cloud. This solution must be in place and properly tested by the end of the current ALA funding
      * HISCOM to develop a protocol for data that does not comply with standard vocabularies
      * HISCOM to endorse BioCASe, TAPIR as well as simpler transfer methods.
      * HISCOM to review HISPID5, particularly the HISPID vocabularies.
      * HISCOM to require data custodians to assign permanent identifiers to the provided records, following TDWG recommendations (http://www.tdwg.org/standards/150).
