#summary what kinds of data can be found in the Atlas?

= Introduction =

=== aspects common to biodiversity data: ===
  # what (taxonomy)
  # when (temporal)
  # where (spatial)
  # who (collectors)
  # _(and sometimes why)_

=== sub-systems of the atlas, where data _surface_ ===
i.e. appear, or are made accessible :
  # biocache
  # spatial portal
  # biodiversity information explorer (bie)
  # collectory
  # morphbank
  # _... not an exhaustive list_

=== different kinds of data ===
the sub-systems may be aware of many logical classes of data:
  # species' observation data (what+when+where+who)
  # species' profile data (what+who, what+where, what+why)
  # resource descriptions (who, what)
  # spatial (environmental) data (where)

|| || observations || profile data || resources || spatial ||
|| biocache || 1 || || || 2 || 
|| spatial portal || 3 || || || 4 || 
|| morphbank || 5 || 6 || || || 
|| bie || || 7 || || 8 || 
|| collectory || || || 9 || || 

=== classes of data relate to each other ===
some of these (types, kinds) of data can be related through common _dimensions_ (or aspects, facets, natural keys, ...):
|| *Relate...* || observations || profile data || spatial layers ||
|| to observations || through preparations, derivation, digitisation, biological relationships, collectors, collection events, statistical analysis || identification, associations (explicit or inferred) || location desc./coordinates, environmental classification || 
|| to profile || through taxonomy, inference || taxonomy, biological interactions || taxonomy ||  
|| to resources || through data provision || taxonomic coverage || spatial layer metadata || 
|| to spatial || through location descriptions or coordinates, species distributions, predictive analysis || with species' distributions || by environmental layer grouping, e.g. median rainfall & max rainfall => 'rainfall'  || 

although there is a number of potential relationships at all intersections, there are common aspects that allow for the relationship to exist; when they are normalised we find ourselves with a list of possible dimensions, common to the kinds of data relevant to biodiversity:

naturally, that wouldn't be complex enough! so follow this link for more specifics as well...
