#summary related records proposal

== Summary ==
This document is a draft proposal for handling relationships between data records. It addresses two main specifications for biodiversity informatics data transfer: DarwinCore (2.x) and HISPID (5)

  # Each record that is to be shared must have a consistent, predictable unique identifier. The record will most likely represent a collection item, but may also represent other related entities, such as the collector, a location or a site visit;
  # This identifier is to be set by the data custodian, in accordance with a pattern agreed to by the relevant institutional group (i.e. informatics peak body);
  # If the record represents data that is derived from other data (e.g. a specimen's image, or dna sequence) then this relationship should be stored in the collection management system, and communicated within the record as well;
  # Depending on the data-standard being used to share information, these identifiers will be stored in consistent and agreed terms (i.e. field names) so these relationships can be found programmatically;
  # The Atlas should provide a web service that:
    * responds to resource identifiers with links to the resource itself,
    * responds to the sub-parts of an identifier with best-guess identifier(s) based on current (and historical) patterns used by the relevant institutional group,
    * and potentially, offer the identifiers of related records as part of the response.
