#summary a generic, logical process for data mobilisation

= Summary =

This page is dedicated to helping data providers organise an implementation. It could apply to one dataset (_i.e._ a discrete sub-system), or its scope might be broadened to include all of an organisation's data, regardless of the system in which they are managed.

== Steps ==


== Outputs (artefacts) ==
The following output comes from _each_ pass (iteration):
  * sample of, or a complete, export of existing data
  * completeness analysis first pass
    * completeness iteration(s) with data provider
    * future enhancements in completeness
  * content analysis first pass
    * recommendations for data standard compliance
  * existing transport method analysis
    * testing for fuller automation (ie, access to upload.ala.org.au, batch jobs & sample scripts for operating system envioronment, etc)
    * recommendation(s) or implementation(s) of batch-upload

These will likely be enhanced at each step, but may also fall stagnant (as proof of poor suitability of a particular idea or method). 

Like all agile methodology, one goal is to reduce overall risk to success by discovering a lack of suitability at the earliest possible point (_i.e._ a 'point of no return' in the budget is reached!) ... the reader can find a detailed description of one such method at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSDM]

=== were goals met? ===

=== were additional constraints identified? ===

=== what about ongoing maintenance? ===


== 04. iteration ==

is there more effort required to achieve the desired outcomes? if yes, iterate
