#summary the ALA data quality analysis sub-system

== Introduction ==
This is not an attempt to document the quality sub-system - merely a pointer for the reader to the volume of information on this many-faceted beast (based on the understanding of someone who has developed some of these tools, and actively uses most of them for quality content analysis)

Quality analysis performed by this subsystem :
  * is domain-specific; a lot of the tests performed make sense in the broader domains of taxonomy, biodiversity and geospatial analysis
  * is statistical; many tests are founded on logic and maths, e.g: _XXX_
  * can alert users to 'fitness-for-use', or _[http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModel completeness]_ issues 

This subsystem does not alert the user to 

== ALA data quality wiki ==
Firstly, there is an Atlas quality wiki: [http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/]. Most of the information here directs the reader to this site, directly to source code, or to logic related to data quality.

=== Quality checks spreadsheet ===
