===Welcome to the Atlas of Living Australia's data mobilisation portal.===

Here you will find resources to help you share your data with everyone using the ALA, along with any code that we have developed, or others have shared with us, to do this.

Where an institution curates their data in systems within their boundaries and as part of their own processes, they may then wish to share their data with the public through the ALA, or take advantage of some of the Atlas' systems to perform data analysis.

This organisation then hosts system code that automates (or makes repeatable) the translation of these data into a standard form (_e.g. [DataStandards DarwinCore]_); this process pushes data to the Atlas periodically, or somehow makes them available for harvest on demand. *Data mobilisation* (DM) is the term we use to describe this concept.

DM is distinct from the more [http://www.ala.org.au/share/ manual, adhoc methods of sharing data], or sharing data by default when using an Atlas [http://www.ala.org.au/tools-services/ sub-system for data management].

This site is loosely arranged around the following concepts:
  * [DataClasses Classes of data and how they surface in the Atlas]
  * [LogicalProcess A logical, more abstract DM process]
  * [Implementations Specific implementations of DM] (coupled to their source systems)
  * [DataStandards DM data standards]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModelDwC DM completeness] (fitness for use, quality at source, ...)
  * [RelatedRecords Identifying relationships] (derived collection items, inferred records, ...)
