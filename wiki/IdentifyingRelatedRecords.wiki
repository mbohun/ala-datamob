#summary patterns for identifying relationships between records

== Scenarios ==

A standing assumption: these are patterns in the source data; the goal is to ensure the data standards support communicating these relationships if the source data capture them.

 # Specimen record holds metadata on multiple preparations
 # Specimen record is a single preparation
 # One or more preparations relate to one or more specimens through a cross-reference table (_note: this situation has not been encountered - if this is your data, give us a yell! thanks..._)
 # Any of the above three, but 'specimen' is already a constituent part (_piece, relationship, derivation_) of another
 # A 'collection item' being a generalisation of the more specific (specimen) in any of the above scenarios
 # Any collection item, from which one or more observations (sightings) are evident - these observations may not necessarily have a determination (taxon)
 # Any collection item representing another in a many to one relationship; eg:
   * a photo of a drawer full of specimens
   * a photo of a flock of birds
   * a digitisation of a sound-reel, having many recordings, each recording a discrete site visit, each recording capturing one or more taxa
