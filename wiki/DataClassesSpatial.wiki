#summary more info on spatial data in the Atlas

== "Spatial Data" distinction ==
In the context of the Atlas there appear to be many forms of spatial data. Generally speaking, the notion relates a _fact_ to a point in space. The fact may be one of a number of concepts that _surface_ (_i.e._ appear, or are made accessible) in various sub-systems:

|| *Context*|| *Fact type* || *Details* || *Where data surface* || *Notes* ||
|| Occurrence || point-location || specimen/species observation || as points in: biocache, spatial portal || see [DataStandardsDwC darwincore] terms  _dwc.[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#decimalLatitude decimalLatitude]_, _dwc.[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#decimalLongitude decimalLongitude]_ and associated metadata; <p>also, review [DataClassesCoordinateQuality] ||
|| Site || point & radius, line, simple or complex boundary || collecting event <p>can be defined as lines, eg: a trawl, or specified as closed boundaries such as a paddock or catchment boundary || as shapes in: biocache?, spatial portal || _dwc.[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#footprintWKT footprintWKT]_ <p>_shape_ data define boundaries and are more complex than simple points, or point & radius ||
|| Environmental (gridded) || sample at point <p>or more likely a _'smoothed'_ or averaged value across a defined area || gridded data are usually (/can be) environmental properties within a particular space <p>properties might be 'rainfall for summer months' or 'primary soil classification' || 'add to map->layers' in spatial portal, <p>biocache also stores a matrix of all environmental data at any given point - somewhat of an 'inverted index' for analysis purposes - visible as 'property-value' pairs within an occurrence record that has been ingested completely <p>(section 'Environmental sampling for this location' at time of writing, example: [http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/2f2cb5b5-819b-4bd3-854b-59849cd13622]) || the spaces are usually normalised to allow easy comparison of variables between data sets (eg: grids of 1km^2^ or 1 degree^2^) ||
|| Contextual (polygonal) || simple or complex boundary || a defined area, and usually some sort of associated classification/value, stored against a specific property <p>eg: property='state/territory', value='NSW'; or <p>[http://spatial.ala.org.au/layers/more/lith_geologicalunitpolygons1m property='soil classification', value='Pfry']; || 'add to map->areas' in spatial portal, <p>as for gridded environmental properties (samples), placement within areas/classifications are also stored against occurrences <p>(section 'Additional political boundaries information' at time of writing, see previous biocache occurrence example) ||  ||
|| Descriptive locations || textual || often found against specimen records, an example might be '13 mi NW dry ck' || sometimes as as verbatim data/quality caveats for records || _dwc.[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#verbatimLocality verbatimLocality]_ <p>may also be used as evidence to georeference or standardise locations ||


= Coordinates =
Distinction - 

== Fundamentals of geospatial coordinates and datums ==
[http://ala-datamob.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/02/0204%20ALAhandlingspatiallocationdata.pdf]

== Key terminology ==
Coordinates (aka. _geocodes, latitude/longitude, lat/long, grid reference, ..._) - effectively an x,y pair 

== Regarding quality of coordinate locations ==
[DataClassesCoordinateQuality]

== Regarding coordinate conversions ==
[DataClassesCoordinateConversion#Conversion]

== Regarding spatial generalisation (location blurring / obfuscation) ==
[DataClassesCoordinateConversion#Obfuscation]




= Spatial layer data =
Distinction - _*TODO:* add info on spatial layers_

== Regarding Lambert Conformal Conic projection (a grid projection in use in some? rural areas) ==
the extent to which this grid projection is used is currently not known - research continues to discover this information - no data sets have been encountered to date that use this form of projection.

it is expected that the above logic (psuedo-code) and such will need to be modified to handle lcc if it proves to be widely used. 

it may be that the prototype mobilisation utility will wind up using the geotrans libraries to handle conversions in a more robust fashion, although my gut feeling at this stage is that the complexity is better handled here within ala servers (maybe called up as a web-service?); in any case the utility should include a switch to enter a test-mode, to ensure that the version of the geotrans native code library that winds up being installed can be accessed from the jvm & performs correct conversions:
