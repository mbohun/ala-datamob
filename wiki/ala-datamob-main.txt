==Welcome to the Atlas of Living Australia's data mobilisation portal.==

Here you will find resources to help you share your data with everyone using the ALA along with any tools or code that we have developed, or others have shared with us, to do this.


===Data mobilisation...===
Where an institution curates their data in systems as part of their own processes, they may then wish to share their data with the public through the ALA, or take advantage of some of the Atlas' systems to perform data analysis.

This organisation then hosts system code that automates (or makes repeatable) the translation of these data into a standard form (_e.g. [DataStandards DarwinCore] or [DataStandards HISPID]_); this process pushes data to the Atlas periodically, or somehow makes them available for harvest on demand. *Data mobilisation* (DM) is the term we use to describe this concept.

DM is distinct from the more [http://www.ala.org.au/share/ manual, adhoc methods of sharing data], or sharing data by default when using an Atlas [http://www.ala.org.au/tools-services/ sub-system for data management].


===Conceptual menu...===
This site is loosely arranged around the following concepts:
  * [DataClasses Classes of data and how they surface in the Atlas]
  * [LogicalProcess A logical, more abstract DM process]
  * [BioDomains Domains in biodiversity] - arbitrary boxing of groups (either core data-gathering or supplementary _aka derived,secondary,satellite,..._ data-generating)
  * [DataStandards Domain-specific data standards]
  * [Implementations Specific implementations of DM] (coupled to their source systems)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModel DM completeness] - external link - (fitness for use, quality at source, ...)
  * [IdentifyingRelatedRecords Identifying relationships] (derived collection items, inferred records, ...) [RelatedRecords and communicating those relationships]


===...or by artefact type===
In case you know exactly what you're looking for:
  * [TypeSourceCode Source code] (implementations sorted by technology)
  * [TypeAlgorithms Algorithms] (more strictly defined; machine logic)
  * [TypeProcesses Analyses] (planning; thinking; learning)
  * [TypeProcesses Processes] (planning; thinking; learning)
