#summary the ALA data ingest sub-system (... pretty important!)


== Introduction ==

This is not an attempt to document the ingest sub-system - merely a pointer to the code base, along with high-level descriptions (based on the understanding of someone who hasn't developed or used these tools, merely relied on their outcomes)


== The overall data provision process ==

This wiki page is concerned only with the *`*`bold steps in the process* applied to occurrence records; preliminary steps are included for context:
  # data provider and the atlas establish new system account, creating a new data resource for each discrete source-system, eg: a collection's specimen-record management system, or species profile database ... [http://collections.ala.org.au/datasets]
  # the atlas generates a SFTP upload account on the upload server
  # *`*`data provider generates an export in [DataStandardsDwC simple-dwc] csv format*
  # *`*`data provider uploads the compressed export*
  # *`*`ingest subsystem periodically checks the sftp server for new files*
  # *`*`a new file is found, downloaded, unpacked and a record loading process triggered*
  # _(note: planned behaviour only at feb 2013)_ *`*`a log of the overall ingest process is left on the sftp server*

=== Requirements for data files presented to ingest ===

=== Loading into the Biocache ===
Records are loaded into the biocache per each data resource 
  # a search for an existing record,
  # an attempt to match a taxon,
  # [AtlasSubsysQuality a series of quality-tests],
  # a test for taxonomic sensitivity against state and commonwealth legislation, and 
  # a search for duplicate or associate records.
