= Summary =

== Introduction ==

This document [http://code.google.com/p/ala-datamob/RelatedRecords] is a draft proposal for handling relationships between data records. The intent of this proposal is to ensure the data standards and best-practice support communicating these relationships if the source data capture them.

*At 07/12/2011 this document is still in draft form* first release for peer review; it supersedes (and subsumes) the earlier [IdentifyingRelatedRecords] document, also on this wiki.


== Relevance ==

This document applies to some of the entities represented in biological collection data (_i.e._ collection items), with a focus on associations amongst specimen (or sighting) records, along with duplicates, other evidential data, or rich content (_i.e._ multimedia). 

It is a retrospective analysis of two commonly-used specifications for biodiversity informatics data transfer: !DarwinCore 2.x and HISPID 5. ABCD 2 is indirectly referenced, of which HISPID5 is implemented as an extension.

The HISPID specific use-cases may conflict with ABCD-usage; an attempt may be made in the future to highlight these, but at the moment the reader should be cautious of this possibility.

See _About the data_ and _Appendix: Relevance to different biodiversity domains_ for more information.

= Requirements =

Note: _the following are prioritised using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method MoSCoW - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method]_


== General (functional) behaviour required of the collection management system ==

  # Each record that is to be shared must have a consistent and predictable unique identifier. The record will most likely represent a collection item, but may also represent other related entities, such as the collector, a location or a site visit;
  # This identifier should be set by the data custodian, in accordance with a pattern agreed to by the relevant institutional group (i.e. informatics peak body);
  # If the record represents data that are derived, or duplicated, from other data (see _About the data : Scenarios giving rise to relationships_) then this relationship should be stored in the collection management system, and communicated within the record using an appropriate method for the data-standard being used to share information (see _About the data : Common patterns in the scenarios_);


== Aggregator-specific behaviour ==

  # Due to the high likelihood of inconsistency, the data aggregator must not build a single composite record from related records that are determined to be duplicates or constituent parts, without:
    * highlighting the inconsistencies,
    * clearly identifying the provenance of such a record as being the aggregator,
    * not aggregating provenance-specific information (_e.g. DwC.institutionCode, HISPID.SourceInstitutionID_), or replacing these data with aggregator-specific information
  # The aggregator shouldn't fail to ingest a partially complete data set or record when encountering unrecognised (non-standard) terms (fields, concepts) in the source data;
  # The aggregator should use methods (see _About the data : Common patterns in the scenarios_) to discover the existence of related records and clearly offer links to, or notification of, these records;
  # The aggregator could provide a (web?) service that:
    * responds to resource identifiers with a method for accessing the resource itself (freely or securely),
    * responds to the sub-parts of an identifier with best-guess identifier(s) based on current (and historical) patterns used by the relevant institutional group,
    * and potentially, offer the identifiers of related records as part of the response.
  # The aggregator could remember relationships between records, and allow users to navigate this graph;
  # The aggregator could infer relationships between records, and allow users to confirm these, which it would also remember;


== Changes to the domain-specific extensions ==

*07/12/2011 NOTE:* These recommendations remain are likely to evolve further...

This document refers to _simple-dwc_, _dwc-archive_, _dwc-xml_, _hispid-light_, _hispid-xml_ - refer to _Appendix: Transport (file) formats in the specifications_ for more details on these concepts.

(for more details on these requirements, see _Proposed specification changes_)


=== ... to FCIG-DwC ===
  # a mechanism to relate a _General_ record to its _principal_ as well as its _parent_ records, one-to-one for a maximum of two relationships, in all forms of dwc (simple, archives and xml);
  # _dwc-archive and dwc-xml only_, ensuring _DwC.!ResourceRelationship_ can relate a record to other record(s), one-to-many (many-to-many?), _n_ relationships;


=== ... to HISPID-ABCD ===
  # a mechanism relate a _Unit_ record to its _principal_ as well as its _parent_ records, one-to-one for a maximum of two relationships, in all forms of hispid;
  # a mechanism to ensure _Unit_-nested records point to the parent _Unit_ _explicitly_ in the data (allowing for these records to be communicated without nesting) :
    * a _UnitID/UnitGUID_ pointer in sub-classes;
    * _!DateLastEdited_ information for each of the sub-classes;
    * nested sub-classes include: _Unit.Acquisition, Unit.Assemblages, Unit.Associations, Unit.Gathering.!SiteImages, Unit.!MultiMediaObjects, Unit.Sequences, !SpecimenUnit.Preparations, !SpecimenUnit.History.!PreviousUnits, ..._
  # _hispid-xml only_, ensuring _HISPID.Unit.Associations_ can relate a record to other record(s), one-to-many, _n_ relationships;
    * consideration must also be given to relating _Unit_-nested records to other _Unit_-nested records;

= About the data =


== Core (primary, parent) and supplementary (duplicated, derived, secondary, child) data ==

In the scope of this logic, *core collection data* are generally the data that find themselves at the source of other data (causally). They are distinguishable to *supplementary collection data*, which are usually derived in some way; _e.g._
  * a specimen (core) which is photographed, the photo being stored in a separate system (supplement);
  * a sound-recording (core) is taken in the field, within which sightings are evident (supplement);
  * a specimen (core) is scanned by a service provider with CT equipment (supplement);

The organisational boundary most likely plays a role in the distinction as well; _e.g._
  * the service provider keeps a database of all ct-scans; the specimen's ct-scan (core) is converted to a lower-fidelity .avi file and offerred on their website (supplement);

Suffice it to say, types of data are likely handled in separate (sub-)systems with separate processes for managing them - this point forces us to reconsider some cases; _e.g._
  * a herbarium photographs a preserved specimen (core), the photo then being shared with full metadata to other institutions, those institutions treating this photo as a specimen in its own right (core);

Consideration must also be given to the _[http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModel completeness]_ ([http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModel]) of the data stored in sub-system(s) as an aggregate whole, or the ability to draw these data into a whole at the time of export; _e.g._
  * a preserved specimen (core) which then has its skin dried and treated as a separate, but related, specimen in another database (core);
  * a dna sample is taken from a live specimen (core, core) which is then passed on with minimal metadata (supplement) _or full metadata (core)_ to another organisation for barcoding/sequencing;

It seems highly unlikely that any attempt to apply labels to organisations' activities will not bring to light cases that contradict the reasoning used to assign these labels. 

As such, _core_ or _supplementary_ can be considered arbitrary labels used to distinguish the roles data play in relationships, analogous to _parent_ and _child_ respectively, with the latter in both cases implying a subordinate relationship to the former. 

All labels are used interchangeably in this document.

= Proposed specification changes =


== Introduction ==

It is a goal of this proposal to define consistent methods for communicating relationships between records; in all cases, the following design-constraints are considered:
  # be flexible but solve the problem, and accept that there are multiple solutions - let the data provider choose the best fit;
  # use the existing standard terms where ever possible, unless the use of these terms in this manner would cause a conflict with the general understanding and/or current practice;
  # add terms only when the following conditions are met:
    # the term name is defined which at least hints at the purpose (_yes, this is purely subjective - but if a number of people agree that the naming makes sense, then that's the best that can be hoped for at this stage_)
    # the term's usage is unambiguously defined in a short description


== Backwards compatibility ==

For true 'backwards compatibility', the newer (extended) version of records must conjur the same behaviour in consuming applications as the earlier version would have.

*One assumption must be made in this regard:* that the data consumer ignores unrecognised fields instead of calling a halt to the load process, or, at worst case, drops this particular record as 'an error'. Ideally, unrecognised fields would be ignored.

In most cases this is possible, however, in some instances where relationships between duplicate records are not clearly defined then multiple 'dots on the map' will appear. It is the hope that in the future some mechanism exists to mine for, seek validation and then remember these relationships - see _Appendix: Relationship mining sub-system (The Relator)_ for more information.


== The principal record ==

The identifier assigned to the physical item that was _"accessioned into a collection from the field"_ (eg. single vouchered specimen, still image, movie or sound recording, field notes, core sample, phial of multiple organisms, etc.). 

The principal record may be associated with many specimen/sighting records, each with a unique identifier (eg. an image or sound recording containing determinations for many species) as well as derivative records such as gene sequences representing a part of the physical item (eg. leg of spider), or unique records representing different layers of a core sample, etc.

The value in this field will be the unique identifier of the principal, i.e. _HISPID.Unit.UnitID_, _HISPID.Unit.UnitGUID_,_HISPID.Unit.Accessions.!AccessionNumber_,  _DwC.Occurrence.occurrenceId_, _DwC.Occurrence.catalogNumber_, ...



== The parent record ==

if the principal record is more than one step removed from this one, you can use this term to communicate the direct parent-child relationship between these two items (_see principal record for more detailed information_)


== Relationship identifiers' source terms: principal and parent ==

These communicate where source data for _principal_ and _parent record_ exist in those record(s), _i.e._ under what term should the data consumer search if they wished to find this _principal_ or _parent record_ identifier? 

This is important because it allows for relationships between different types of records (_i.e. different bases; image:specimen, duplicate image:image..._)

Recommended best practice is to use one of the standard dwc/hispid term names used to identify a record, e.g. _HISPID.Unit.UnitID_, _HISPID.Unit.UnitGUID_,_HISPID.Unit.Accessions.!AccessionNumber_,  _DwC.Occurrence.occurrenceId_, _DwC.Occurrence.catalogNumber_, ...


== Types of relationships ==

This term communicates each type of relationship. Recommended best practice is to use the controlled vocab, _e.g._ image, sound, sighting, duplicate, donation, slide, dna, sequence, _blah..._

Topics for discussion are the controlled vocab, and whether it highlights 'copies of copies'.


== Generic _n-relationships_ logical/sub class: _DwC.!RelatedResources_ and _HISPID.Unit.Associations_ ==

DwC: object-relationship-subject model;
HISPID: parent-subordinate model;

desired attributes for each relationship :
    * principal (parent, primary, subject) identifier value; _i.e. a unique identifier_
    * principal (parent, primary, subject) identifier source term; _i.e. the field we'll search to find the unique identifiers_
    * supplementary (child, subordinate, object) identifier value;
    * supplementary (child, subordinate, object) source term;
    * relationship type;
    * relationship relevant at _date_;
    * relationship according to;
    * ... 


== Other attributes or entities relevant to collections ==

Collectors, sites, localities, collection events, field collections, surveys; in cases where this information is not an attribute of the record, these data are generally related to the others through one of the following methods:
  * explicitly associated through a _[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key foreign key - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key]_ relationship, _i.e._ a pointer in a specific term within a record, to the unique identifier of another entity; e.g. _DwC.locationID_, _HISPID.XXX_
  * implied through a nested data structure, _i.e._ _HISPID.Unit.MultiMediaObjects.MultiMediaObject_


== Additional thoughts... ==


=== why have a _principal_ *and* a _parent_ ===
complex (deep) hierarchical relationships can be communicated and navigated quite effectively (reliably) with this two-level (root, parent) model, whereas there is a significant level of uncertainty associated with a 'one level up' hierarchy, especially across organisational boundaries; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory here's some bedtime reading on the topic...]

=== _principal, parent_: why not imply an object-relationship-subject pattern (ie, bi-directional); instead, a subordinate relationship is implied ===
gut feeling is this becomes _too_ complex, whereas it is the _simple_ forms that are likely to use _principal_ and _parent_... where desire exists to point in both directions within the one, it might be time to use the appropriate _n_-relationships class

=== Preparations versus basis of record ===
  * The concepts 'basis of record' (DwC: _basisOfRecord_ + _dcterms:type_; HISPID: _!KindOfUnit_ + _!RecordBasis_) and 'specimen preparations' (DwC: _preparations_; HISPID: _Preparations_) are metadata.
  * In HISPID/ABCD, _Preparations_ are nested under _!SpecimenUnit_ 
  * source data – does each record represent a preparation? or are all preparations for a principal collection item aggregated into the one record?

== Changes to the FCIG-DwC extension ==

*07/12/2011 NOTE: these are likely to evolve further*

To FCIG-DwC; and after community consultation, ALA to propose to GBIF for ratification+inclusion in standard DwC :

  # a mechanism to relate a _General_ record to its _principal_ as well as its _parent_ records, one-to-one for a maximum of two relationships, in all forms of dwc (simple, archives and xml);
    # add _principalRelResourceID_ to _Record_;
    # add _principalRelResourceTerm_ to _Record_;
    # add _principalRelType_ to _Record_;
    # add _parentRelResourceID_ to _Record_;
    # add _parentRelResourceTerm_ to _Record_;
    # add _parentRelType_ to _Record_;
    # _with the following still being agonised over (*simple*-dwc remember!)..._
      * add _principalRelID_ to _Record_;
      * add _principalRelDate_ to _Record_;
      * add _parentRelID_ to _Record_;
      * add _parentRelDate_ to _Record_;
  # _dwc-archives and dwc-xml only_, using _DwC.!ResourceRelationship_ to relate a record to other record(s), one-to-many (many-to-many?), _n_ relationships:
    # add _resourceIDTerm_ to _ResourceRelationship_
    # add _relatedResourceIDTerm_ to _ResourceRelationship_


== Consideration to the existing DwC standard ==

While being discounted as a preferred way of communicating relationships, all of these are viable mechanisms for relationship mining - see _Appendix: Relationship mining sub-system (The Relator)_ for more information.

=== why add terms to _Record_? ===
so people who use simple-dwc can communicate record relationships

=== _DwC.!ResourceRelationship_ ===
looks like it covers most scenarios:
  * need to confirm _n_-nested records
  * need to test with dwc-archives
  * ... more to follow on this one

=== _occurrenceID_ to relate records ===
  * relationship is implied
  * usage pattern likely to be unintuitive and contradictory to existing practice
  * the water in this pool is already muddy...

=== _catalogNumber_ to relate records ===
  * viable option, but relationship is still implied

=== _associatedOccurrences_ to relate records ===
  * spec is worded such that i believe the intent here is to define familial/individual's relationships;
  * still a viable option, but would need to specialise the meaning (set some rules around the usage) of this term (& related terms) in the fcig domain

=== _associatedTaxa_ to relate records ===
  * spec is worded such that the intent here is to define symbiotic  relationships;
  * this term could be overloaded to do the job, but this would need to be trialled first to see how things go...

=== _associatedMedia_ to relate records ===
  * this falls over when we try to relate a multimedia record with other multimedia records, as _associatedMedia_ is the pointer _to_ the media (and therefore can't be used to point to the related media!)

=== _associatedSequences_ to relate records ===
  * suffers from the same problem as _associatedMedia_ when relating any sequence record to other sequences... can't imagine a case where this would happen though - is this you?

== Changes to the HISPID specification ==

*07/12/2011 NOTE: these are likely to evolve further*

To HISPID, and after community consultation / trial of changes, proposed to TDWG for inclusion in ABCD.

  # a mechanism relate a _Unit_ record to its _principal_ as well as its _parent_ records, one-to-one for a maximum of two relationships, in all forms of hispid;
    # add _principalUnitID_ to _Unit_;
    # add _principalUnitTerm_ to _Unit_;
    # add _principalRelType_ to _Unit_;
    # add _parentUnitID_ to _Unit_;
    # add _parentUnitTerm_ to _Unit_;
    # add _parentRelType_ to _Unit_;
    # _with the following still being agonised over (hispid-*light* remember!)..._
      * add _principalRelID_ to _Unit_;
      * add _principalRelDate_ to _Unit_;
      * add _parentRelID_ to _Unit_;
      * add _parentRelDate_ to _Unit_;
  # a mechanism to relate _Unit_-nested related records to the parent _Unit_ _explicitly_ in the data (allowing for these records to be communicated without nesting) :
    * sub-classes (_Unit.Acquisition, Unit.Assemblages, Unit.Associations, Unit.Gathering.!SiteImages, Unit.!MultiMediaObjects, Unit.Sequences, !SpecimenUnit.Preparations, !SpecimenUnit.History.!PreviousUnits, ..._) must display the following attributes :
      * a _UnitID/UnitGUID_ pointer;
      * _!DateLastEdited_ information;
  # _hispid-xml only_, ensuring _HISPID.Unit.Associations_ can relate a record to other record(s), one-to-many, _n_ relationships:
    # add _!AssociationDate_;
    # add _AssociationID_;
    # confirm _UnitGUID_ points to _this unit_ (not _that unit_);
    * consideration must also be given to relating _Unit_-nested records to other _Unit_-nested records;

=== Some early HISPID analysis ... ===
This section looks at the problem from the hispid perspective; this is what i want to do in hispid - what cases does it apply to? Here is a crude glossary:

  * images - read ‘multimedia’; the assumption is that these are at least indexed in digital form somewhere (with appropriate metadata to find the object, if the image itself has not been digitised);
  * storage mechanism - the database (/filestore/card-file...) that holds the data;
  * 'separate storage mechanisms' imply a challenge in integrating the data; some types of the impediments encountered so far are a lack of technical capability, a physical separation & a temporal separation;
  * _Unit_ - 
  * _!SiteImage_ (SI for short) - [http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdConcept1138 DataSets/DataSet/Units/Unit/Gathering/SiteImages/SiteImage http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdConcept1138]
  * _!MultiMediaObject_, (MMO for short) - [http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdConcept0772 DataSets/DataSet/Units/Unit/MultiMediaObjects/MultiMediaObject http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdConcept0772]
  * _SpecimenUnit_ - a specialisation of _Unit_ - [http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdConcept0404 DataSets/DataSet/Units/Unit/SpecimenUnit http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdConcept0404]

==== _!SpecimenUnit_ record with nested _!SiteImage_ record(s) ====

==== _!SpecimenUnit_ record with nested _!MultiMediaObject_ record(s) ====

==== _!MultiMediaObject_/_!SiteImage_ record stands alone, from which sighting (specimen?) records are interpolated ====

HISPID would allow for this but each inferred _!SpecimenUnit_ record must have a nested MMO/SI record - in turn, each MMO/SI record would be a redundant copy of the other(s), with all the MMO/SI records sharing the same identifier.

==== An image collection item is treated like more traditional specimen(s); this image may be related to other more traditional specimen(s) ====

In this case, the image is the _!SpecimenUnit_; it may be a duplicate, or derivation, of other SpecimenUnit(s); it has nested _!MultiMediaObject(s)_ to point to the image where it resides (usage pattern 1).

    The image may be managed in a digital asset management system (DAMS) or it might be simply a file sent on the email from another institution.
    It may be desirable as the aggregator to keep both source records (the whole may be equal to or greater than the sum of the parts); however, in this case, the relationship between both records must be maintained.


==== _!SpecimenUnit_ record and _!MultiMediaObject_ / _!SiteImage_ record stand alone but share a 1:1 relationship ====

'separate storage mechanisms' imply some challenge in integrating the data; up until this point, it is assumed that the data provider will be able to build an aggregate SpecimenUnit record at the time of export, when they are communicating imagery associated with the specimen;

some types of the impediments to this 'just-in-time aggregation' that have been encountered so far are a lack of technical capability, a physical separation & a temporal separation;

_!MultiMediaObject_ or _!SiteImage_ records are nested under _Unit_ (spec suggests that MMO/SI is part of unit); however, MMO/SI has no way of communicating explicitly that it belongs to _!Unit_ - without this mechanism, each of these types of records could not exist in separate files, yet still maintain their relationship;

this usage pattern doesn’t appear to be supported by hispid as it stands; we would need to add a term to MMO/SI to point to its related _!Unit_ - so it is anticipated that the main users of such a mechanism would have a need to communicate _!SpecimenUnit_ records completely separately  to their image records, yet have a desire that these be related.

== Appendix: URNs as record identifiers ==

Uniform resource names (URNs) are textual data intended for use as identifiers of other data or services (resources), and display the following attributes:
  * They must follow a certain pattern and contain information identifying the custodian of the resource (the namespace), as well as the resource itself (the name).
  * Patterns that URNs follow must be predictable, so data users can derive them from information they may already have (if they don't have the URN itself).
  * URNs must remain consistent (i.e. always point to the same thing).
  * URNs are defined by the data custodian, and may follow a pattern or rules specified by the custodian or a broader affiliation of custodians (e.g. a biodiversity domain).
  * URNs need not be 'doled out by a central repository' although some namespaces or broader groupings do this as part of a standard.
  * Given only an identifier, a data user should be able to find more information from someone or something about the resource itself (if not the resource).

A standing assumption: relationships between records are captured in the data management processes, and are evident in the source data.

=== A little about patterns ===
A pattern can be thought of as a generic method for solving a particular problem. It doesn't delve into specifics per se, rather, defines the requirements for a solution.

It is then up to the implementation to ensure the requirements are met within its own context (_more info: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29]_).

It could be said that the scenarios themselves are actually instances of a particular solution to a problem, each within a given context and/or domain. A solution exists within its source-system's boundaries, generating and/or capturing data relevant to its activities - this forms part of your operational data store.

=== Why bother identifying these patterns? ===
When it comes time to map these data to a standard form, we must ensure the relationship information continues to be discoverable in an explicit manner: at the business end, we need a way to handle each of the 'common denominators' in each of the data standards we are referring to in this document.

In addition to this, it is with some certainty that scenarios will arise that are not in the above list; however, a method for solving that problem will have already been defined.

Some of these methods will be applicable to the specifications as they stand, and others will require a currently non-standard solution. This is clearly defined in _Standards-specific usage patterns_.

=== More on relationships ===
In database parlance, the _cardinality_ of a particular relationship is defined in a handful of ways:  one-to-one, one-to-many (/many-to-one) and many-to-many (_see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_%28data_modeling%29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_%28data_modeling%29]_).

The right choice depends on the process and data being captured; but the method employed to communicate these will likely differ even within the same circumstance. 


== Appendix: Embedding a google docs spreadsheet in a wiki page ==

In your google docs spreadsheet: *File* menu -> *Publish to the web*; then click *Start publishing*; then scroll down to _Get a link..._ and choose *Web page* from the drop-down menu; finally, copy the url from the text box - you will need this url in the wiki markup that follows...

In the wiki markup (customising the following code to suit your specific case)...
{{{
<wiki:gadget url="http://hosting.gmodules.com/ig/gadgets/file/117808631063490062819/url.xml" up_Url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AiNWJFdh4pHZdDY2cEgxdHZ5YlBoTUx4MGVfVTgyTGc&single=true&gid=0&output=html" up_Title="matrix" up_height=360 width="97%" up_refresh=6000 />
