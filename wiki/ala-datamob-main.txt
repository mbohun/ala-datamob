==Welcome to the Atlas of Living Australia's data mobilisation portal.==

Here you will find resources to help you share your data with everyone using the ALA along with any tools or code that we have developed, or others have shared with us, to do this.


===Data mobilisation...===
Where an institution curates their data in systems as part of their own processes, they may then wish to share their data with the public through the ALA, or take advantage of some of the Atlas' systems to perform data analysis.

This organisation then hosts system code that automates (or makes repeatable) the translation of these data into a standard form (_e.g. [DataStandards DarwinCore] or [DataStandards HISPID]_); this process pushes data to the Atlas periodically, or somehow makes them available for harvest on demand by any interested party. *Data mobilisation* (DM) is the term we use to describe this concept.

DM is distinct from the more [http://www.ala.org.au/share/ manual, adhoc methods of sharing data], or sharing data by default when using an Atlas [http://www.ala.org.au/tools-services/ sub-system for data management].


===Conceptual menu...===
This site is loosely arranged around the following concepts:
  * [DataClasses Classes of data and how they surface in the Atlas]
  * [LogicalProcess A logical, more abstract DM process]
  * [BioDomains Domains in biodiversity] - arbitrary boxing of groups (either core data-gathering or supplementary _aka derived,secondary,satellite,..._ data-generating)
  * [SpatialData Spatial data]
  * [DataStandards Domain-specific data standards]
  * [Implementations Specific implementations of DM] (coupled to their source systems)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/CompletenessModel DM completeness] - external link - (fitness for use, quality at source, ...)
  * [IdentifyingRelatedRecords Identifying relationships] (derived collection items, inferred records, ...) [RelatedRecords and communicating those relationships]


===...or by artefact type===
In case you know exactly what you're looking for:
  * [TypeSourceCode Source code] (implementations sorted by technology)
  * [TypeAlgorithms Algorithms] (more strictly defined; machine logic)
  * [TypeProcesses Analyses] (scheming)
  * [TypeProcesses Processes] (plotting)


===Hand over everything at once...===
You can see all content (wiki, source-code, ...) through the googe: [http://code.google.com/p/ala-datamob/source/browse/#svn http://code.google.com/p/ala-datamob/source/browse/#svn]; the wiki only is found here: [http://code.google.com/p/ala-datamob/source/browse/#svn%2Fwiki http://code.google.com/p/ala-datamob/source/browse/#svn%2Fwiki]

In addition to the above, you can take a local copy of all the content (except the DM completeness section) by using the following svn url: 
  * [https://ala-datamob.googlecode.com/svn] (_note:_ if you are use tortoise svn then use this as the 'url of repository' when you 'svn checkout' - the absence of credentials gives you read-only access)
  * if you need a good windows svn client, i recommend [http://tortoisesvn.net/ tortoise svn - http://tortoisesvn.net/]
  * more info for a command-line checkout is here: [http://code.google.com/p/ala-datamob/source/checkout] (_this assumes familiarity with your local instance of svn/git/..._)


===Contact us...===
It's early days for this wiki; in time, things might evolve from a scantily clad jumble of notes - feel free to make comments through the wiki interface or directly... if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us using the following (in order of preference):
