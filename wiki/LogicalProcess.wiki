#summary a generic, logical process for data mobilisation

= Summary =
This page is dedicated to helping data providers organise an implementation. It could apply to one dataset (_i.e._ a discrete sub-system), or its scope might be broadened to include all of an organisation's data, regardless of the system in which they are managed.

== Proposed iterations (phases) ==
  # an _export storage mechanism_ to hold your data for your own (private) purposes, _e.g._ data analysis & planning, and a _push mechanism_ to bundle and send the data (_e.g._ sftp);
  # the _export storage mechanism_ revised to hold data in a [DataStandards standard form] (_i.e._ for public consumption) with a working _push mechanism_, _i.e._ proof of ability to move data externally;
  # _if desired_, a mechanism that supports on-demand harvesting by interested parties, _e.g._ a biocase data provider, or a website download;

see _More details : implementing_ for more detail on these concepts...

== Steps for each iteration ==
  # plan - decide what you want to achieve;
  # implement - prove the plan; build a functional prototype;
  # review - the output, ascertain whether the original goals were met;
  # iterate

== Outputs (artefacts) ==
The following output exists after the first pass (iteration):
  # sample of (or a complete) export of existing data, not necessarily in one of the [DataStandards standard forms];
  # completeness analysis first pass:
    * completeness iteration(s) with data provider
    * future enhancements in completeness
  # content analysis first pass:
    * recommendations for data standard compliance
  # existing transport method analysis:
    * testing for fuller automation (ie, access to upload.ala.org.au, batch jobs & sample scripts for operating system envioronment, etc)
    * recommendation(s) or implementation(s) of batch-upload

These outputs will likely be enhanced _with each pass_, but improvements may also cease (as proof of poor suitability of a particular idea). 

Like all agile methodology, a main goal is to reduce overall risk to success by discovering a lack of suitability at the earliest possible point (_i.e._ a 'point of no return' in the budget is reached!) ... the reader can find a detailed description of one such method at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSDM]

== 03. review ==

=== were goals met? ===

=== were additional constraints identified? ===

=== what about ongoing maintenance? ===


== 04. iteration ==

is there more effort required to achieve the desired outcomes? if yes, iterate
